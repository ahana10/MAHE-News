‚ÄúUAB‚Äôs active participation and support of the symposium in Manipal, India, tangibly demonstrates the breadth of educational and professional development experiences our students should expect to get in the MSGH degree,‚Äù said Matt Heimann, M.D., associate director for Educational Programs for the UAB Mary Heersink Institute for Global Health (UAB MHIGH). ‚ÄúIt is evident that they will be equipped with pragmatic research tools and be exposed to a global classroom that will translate into enhanced professional opportunities.‚Äù

Heimann and other MSGH degree leaders wanted to give students an invaluable firsthand experience by attending this event. Participants were able to interact with peers from diverse nationalities and backgrounds. The in-person platform for global engagement expanded their global networks and provided an opportunity to enhance their ability to operate seamlessly in a global health environment with collaborators from various backgrounds.

‚ÄúOur MSGH degree is a uniquely innovative collaboration between the UAB schools of medicine and public health,‚Äù said Alan T. N. Tita, M.D., Ph.D., senior associate dean for Global and Women‚Äôs Health and UAB MHIGH Director. ‚ÄúBy participating in a global consortium alongside nine other institutions in both low- and high-income countries, the program amplifies opportunities for our students and faculty to both engage in a global classroom of online core courses and then acquire hands-on experience in-person in India.‚Äù

With this being UAB's inaugural participation in the symposium since launching the MSGH degree, the primary objectives were centered on educational enrichment and collaborative group work, mapping local health systems in resource-constrained environments, and applying classroom-learned global health skills in practical settings. Moreover, it was anticipated that the symposium would provide a platform for international experts to offer tailored feedback on students' ongoing research projects, further enhancing their professional development.

‚ÄúI was deeply impressed with how the students were so supportive of each other during the weekend conference with all the thesis proposals and scholarly paper descriptions,‚Äù said Paul Erwin, M.D., dean of the UAB School of Public Health. ‚ÄúI know one of our students, Divya Annamalai, had a great experience at Manipal, and I look forward to returning next year with more students.‚Äù

The prospect of presenting their master's thesis research and meeting their virtual peers from McMaster University in person added significant appeal to the experience.

""The two-week experience, featuring exploration of the Indian health care system, collaborative group work, discussions with diverse individuals, and extensive networking seemed like a valuable opportunity,"" said Divya Annamalai, a research assistant for Sparkman Center for Global Health who was the first and sole MSGH student from UAB to attend the symposium.. ""The opportunity allowed us to explore the mental health care system in Uddupi and identify both the gaps and strides, particularly concerning continuum of care.‚Äù

The cultural exchange within their group left a lasting impression, emphasizing the importance of cross-cultural communication and collaboration.

""The MSGH program has been incredibly rewarding... allowing me to expand my knowledge, perspectives, and innovative thinking in global health,‚Äù said Annamalai.

Looking ahead to her future endeavors in medical school, Annamalai aims to integrate her learnings to advance health equity and access.

The symposium's diverse participant base, comprising over 270 students from nine universities, facilitated valuable networking opportunities and exposure to high-impact material. To ensure successful participation, UAB's delegation undertook meticulous preparations. The opportunity was shared with students, orientation sessions were conducted, and support was enlisted from faculty at McMaster University and Maastricht University. Additionally, senior leaders from the UAB Heersink School of Medicine and the UAB School of Public Health provided vital support, both financially and through active participation in the symposium, underscoring the significance of the experience.

‚ÄúIn my almost 40 years of working in public health, I have never seen or experienced anything quite like this symposium in India,‚Äù said Erwin. ‚ÄúIn a recent meeting with UAB leadership, Dean Agarwal and I were both able to report on what an incredible opportunity this was for UAB, and how uplifting it was to see students and faculty from such a wide range of countries working in solidarity to address the great global health challenges of our times.‚Äù

Both Dean Erwin and Anupam Agarwal, M.D., dean of the UAB Heersink School of Medicine, were excited to see the impact the symposium had on UAB students and looking forward to seeing the benefits of future opportunities available to MSGH students.

""UAB‚Äôs active participation and support of the Global Health Symposium in Manipal, India, exemplifies the rich educational and professional development experiences our MSGH students can expect,"" said Agarwal. ""This engagement equips our students with invaluable research tools, real-world experience, and enhanced professional opportunities while forging global connections that benefit both UAB faculty and students.""

The Manipal Academy of Higher Education (MAHE), Manipal, and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) joined together in this initiative of an aerial healthcare delivery system using drones. The first sample was sent from Karkala to Manipal, according to a release from Kasturba Hospital.

The initiative aims to utilise drones for transporting oncopathological samples between peripheral and tertiary care hospitals in Karnataka, the release added.

Meanwhile, an ICMR post in X said: ‚ÄúNext milestone achieved in healthcare delivery via drone! Tissue sample transported mid-surgery from a periperal hospital to advanced pathological testing at teriary setting for deciding if the resected issue is cancerous or not.‚Äù

It said that the drone service reduced the travel time between the two towns (Karkala and Manipal) from 60 minutes to 16 minutes (to cover 37 kms).

‚ÄúReducing the time from 60 minutes to 16 minutes (37 km), this innovative approach would enable faster decisions during surgery and improved access to high-level healthcare for patients in peripheral hospitals, ‚Äù ICMR said in X post.

The Kasturba Hospital release said that the primary objective of this initiative is to assess the feasibility of transferring materials, such as frozen section samples from remote locations to peripheral hospitals using aerial means. This endeavor is expected to enhance the healthcare system by enabling surgeons to perform procedures requiring such investigations in rural areas, it said.

In India, the lack of intraoperative sample transportation from rural areas presents a significant challenge. The drone project explores the feasibility, utility, and cost-effectiveness of drones for this purpose. By leveraging drone technology, samples can be transported swiftly, providing immediate access to advanced diagnostics like frozen sections during surgical procedures. If successful, this research could revolutionise healthcare delivery by establishing connections between remote hospitals and laboratory facilities, thereby facilitating complex surgeries for patients in geographically inaccessible regions, the release added.

Universities are aware of the need to forge strong collaborations with stakeholders in the higher education sector. However, setting clear goals and implementing effectual strategies are key to maximising student success in the region. The Country Pavilions at the 2024 THE Asia Universities Summit showcased universities from across Asia ‚Äì with day one focusing on India and the Philippines ‚Äì highlighting their achievements, the importance of collaboration and how they align learning pathways with the United Nations‚Äô Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Madhu Chitkara, pro chancellor of Chitkara University in India, said universities can augment collaborations if they can make the most of each other‚Äôs strengths. ‚ÄúWe have to discuss what verticals we can work on together,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe want international collaboration so that we can learn from each other and make it a part of our curricula and systems.‚Äù

Usually, stakeholders expect financial benefits from such collaborations, but the primary focus should be on creating societal impact, said Karunakar Annappa Kotegar, director of international collaboration at the Manipal Academy of Higher Education.

Anurag Satpathy, professor at Siksha ‚ÄòO‚Äô Anusandhan in India, agreed, suggesting that universities must be clear about why they want to forge collaborations. ‚ÄúOnce we have the focus right, we can add collaborators,‚Äù Satpathy said, sharing that the university‚Äôs Centre for Environment and Climate provides real-time lightning detection and weather forecasts in partnership with Earth Networks in the US and the India Meteorological Department.

Support from governments is crucial, said Nestor Ong, deputy director for QS and THE Rankings at the University of Santo Tomas in the Philippines. The university collaborates with the Climate Change Commission in the Philippines to align its contributions with the SDGs.

Learning opportunities such as internships stemming from partnerships broaden graduates‚Äô experiential learning and build skills, said the panellists. S. N. Sridhara, vice-chancellor of the Hindustan Institute of Technology and Science, said that the university prides itself on having established the Korean Language and Culture Centre in collaboration with the King Sejong Institute (KSI) in South Korea. As the only KSI centre in India, it facilitates cultural awareness, knowledge transfer and student mobility between the two countries.

Strong partnerships empower students to work closely with industry and society, said Visalakshi Talakokula, assistant dean of academics and research and development at √âcole Centrale School of Engineering and head of the Internal Quality Assurance Cell at the Mahindra University in India. ‚ÄúWe can have mutual benefits and complement each other in areas of expertise,‚Äù she said.

As many as two Indian universities have ranked in the top 100 list. The Mahatma Gandhi University, Kerala ranked 81 while Anna University, Chennai is at 96th position. There is an increase in representation and a rise in the ranking positions of many institutions in Turkey, India and Iran.

Other universities such as Bharathiar University, Coimbatore at 113, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Patna (117), Shoolini University of Biotechnology and Management Sciences, Solan (121), IIT Gandhinagar (151), International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad (151), Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham (163), Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Pune (165), KIIT University, Bhubaneswar (168), VIT University, Vellore (173), Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Karnataka (175), Saveetha Institute of Medical and Technical Sciences, Chennai (194), Alagappa University, Tamil Nadu, Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Kolkata, Indian Institute of Technology Ropar, Punjab, Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology Delhi, Jamia Hamdard University, Delhi, Jaypee University of Information Technology, Noida, Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University, Jammu, Siksha ‚ÄòO‚Äô Anusandhan, Odisha, UPES, Uttarakhand have ranked between 201-250.

Meanwhile, Amity University, Noida, IIT Mandi, Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University Anantapur (JNTUA), Andhra Pradesh, JSS Academy of Higher Education and Research, Karnataka, Kalasalingam Academy of Research and Education, Karnataka, Lovely Professional University, Punjab, Pondicherry University have ranked between 251-300. Several more universities have achieved various positions.

Janet Ilieva, founder and director of the consultancy Education Insight, said the countries to watch were those with the capacity for growth. ‚ÄúCountries with [university] participation rates below the world average of 40% have significant room to grow. This is further strengthened by their demographic outlook and projected growth for tertiary education-aged learners,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúWhile East Asia and the Pacific currently have the largest share of global higher education, growth in the next decade and beyond is likely to mainly come from South Asia (India and Pakistan) and beyond South-east Asia, such as Nigeria.‚Äù

Professor Achyuta Samanta, founder, KIIT University, Bhubaneswar says, ‚ÄúThe ranking reflects institution‚Äôs relentless pursuit of academic excellence. We are committed to provide world-class education and for preparing students to be global leaders.‚Äù

Here is the list of the Young University Rankings.

In 2024, the ranking included around 673 universities, up from 605 in 2023. A further 499 institutions are listed with ‚Äòreporter‚Äô status, meaning that they provided data but did not meet our eligibility criteria to receive a rank.

The rankings list the world‚Äôs best universities that are 50 years old or younger. The table is based on the same performance indicators as the flagship THE World University Rankings, but the weightings have been adjusted to give less weight to reputation. The 2024 editions of the rankings introduce significant updates to the original methodology.

The universities are judged across all their core missions such as teaching, research, knowledge transfer and international outlook, to provide the most comprehensive and balanced comparisons available.

Nanyang Technological University, Singapore tops the league table for the second year in a row. Hong Kong continues to have a strong presence in the top 10, but it‚Äôs a mixed picture in terms of individual university performance. The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology has slipped from second to third place and Hong Kong Polytechnic University from fourth to seventh, but the City University of Hong Kong has risen two places to fourth.",no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,no,no
Manipal‚Äôs Ranjan Pai eyes Byju‚Äôs stake in Aakash,news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWhpbmR1YnVzaW5lc3NsaW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzL2VkdWNhdGlvbi9tYW5pcGFscy1yYW5qYW4tcGFpLWV5ZXMtYnlqdXMtc3Rha2UtaW4tYWFrYXNoL2FydGljbGU2Nzk5MDkxMy5lY2XSAXtodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVoaW5kdWJ1c2luZXNzbGluZS5jb20vbmV3cy9lZHVjYXRpb24vbWFuaXBhbHMtcmFuamFuLXBhaS1leWVzLWJ5anVzLXN0YWtlLWluLWFha2FzaC9hcnRpY2xlNjc5OTA5MTMuZWNlL2FtcC8?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen,25-Mar,BusinessLine,"Months after taking a large stake in Byju‚Äôs owned Aakash Educational Services, Ranjan Pai, chairman of Manipal Education and Medical Group is readying to take a larger stake in Aakash.

According to several highly placed sources, Pai is eyeing at 42 per cent stake collectively held by Byju Raveendran and Think and Learn (see chart). Think and Learn is the holding company of Byju‚Äôs. Apparently, Pai has offered to acquire the stake at a valuation of $700 ‚Äì 800 million, which is at a slight premium to the valuations at which Pai acquired stake in Aakash earlier this year.

Easier option

For cash-strapped Byju‚Äôs tangled in multiple lawsuits, selling stakes to Pai could offer respite to its sinking financials. In September last year, Byju‚Äôs had put two of its subsidiaries ‚Äì Epic and Great Learning, on the block. ‚ÄúThere hasn‚Äôt been any firm interest on these assets so far and the transactions are hanging by the hook with no progress,‚Äù said a person familiar with the matter.

With Aakash being the jewel crown for Byju‚Äôs, encashing stake in the company could be an easier option, fetching better valuations vis-√†-vis other businesses.

However, a spokesperson for Byju‚Äôs, when contacted over an email, said, ‚ÄúThere is no such conversation taking place between Think and Learn and Manipal Education Group.‚Äù

Nonetheless, sources say the deal would be a win-win for Byju‚Äôs and Pai.

All or nothing

Meanwhile, expanding stake to 82 per cent would strengthen Pai‚Äôs position in Aakash‚Äôs board. ‚ÄúRight now, the vetoing power is still with Byju‚Äôs and that goes against Pai‚Äôs style of operating. He would like to have everything or nothing when it comes to board decisions,‚Äù said another highly placed source.

It is also learnt that if Pai‚Äôs offer to Raveendran and Think and Learn is turned down, he may want to exit Aakash at a valuation of $600 million. ‚ÄúThis is approximately the price at which Pai entered Aakash and his decision has been communicated to the board and Raveendran,‚Äù said a source quoted earlier.

Further with the Chaudhry family, erstwhile Promoters of Aakash backing off from the share-swap deal which would have given them commensurate stake in Think and Learn and was part of the original share purchase agreement, it needs to be seen how they would continue to hold interest in Aakash.

In November 2022, Ranjan Pai invested about $200 million in Aakash to help Byju‚Äôs clear its loan outstanding to Davidson Kempner and is said to have has invested around $300 million so far in Aakash including the equity conversion that concluded last year.

Recently, a group of investors in Byju‚Äôs parent Think & Learn (T&L) unanimously voted to remove founder Byju Raveendran at the EGM held on February 23. The Karnataka High Court extended the interim order asking the shareholders not to bring in effect any resolutions passed by investors at EGM.

In FY22, Byju‚Äôs reported net loss of ‚Çπ8,245 crore as against ‚Çπ4,564 crore of loss in FY21.

""Throughout our illustrious history, MAHE has consistently been a magnet for foreign students seeking academic excellence in India,"" stated Lt Gen (Dr) M. D. Venkatesh, Vice-Chancellor of MAHE, Manipal.

‚ÄúDating back to the establishment of our inaugural self-financed medical college in 1953, we opened our doors to Malaysian students, a tradition that has proudly endured over the years. The partnership between Deakin and MAHE has been marked by a proactive commitment to internationalization, and it fills me with immense enthusiasm to announce the formal establishment of the Deakin HUB in Manipal. This momentous step signifies our collective resolve to elevate our partnership to unprecedented heights.

The students allege they were not informed about the bond while taking admission into the MBBS course. Additionally, now they are being asked to sign an affidavit for undertaking compulsory rural service for one year and submit an NOC issued by the Bond Enforcement Cell, Arogya Soudha to obtain their permanent registration with the Karnataka Medical Council.

Therefore, the students approached the Karnataka High Court against the state authorities for imposing a compulsory rural bond service on the students. Earlier, EdexLive reported that the students are trying to get their case listed for Tuesday, May 14, as it wasn't heard by the vacation bench in the last two hearings.

Speaking to EdexLive, the student said, ""It cannot be done overnight. This kind of information has to be given in advance or at least during the time of admissions.""



""Even competitive exams are coming up. NOC (No Objection Certificate) is very important for seeking permanent registration with the Karnataka Medical Council. The state government cannot impose compulsory rural bond policy now,"" the student, who is preparing for NEET PG (National Eligibility Entrance Test for Post Graduation) 2024 objected.



Hailing from a middle-class family, the student expects cancellation of the compulsory rural bond policy. ""We were not informed about it before and we are not ready for it now,"" he said.



Similarly, another student said, ""It took five and a half years to get to this point and we have at least four more years to go till we get a Doctor of Medicine (MD) or a Master of Surgery (MS) degree.""



""Most of us are 23 or 24 now and have recently completed pursuing our bachelor's degree and now, have to attempt another ruthless entrance exam to secure a master's degree. But we are being told we have to serve an additional bond year or pay Rs 15 lakh,"" she complained.



Rural betterment?

Refuting the claims by the government that the bond is for the betterment of the rural population, the student said, ""They claim it's for the betterment of the rural population and they're assigning the doctors based on a merit list."" She alleged that students who top the merit list can refuse to serve the bond period and that they are permitted to do so. This resulted in the remaining students being compelled to serve the bond year or pay several lakhs to escape it.



""And even if you are spared this year, in case of an emergency befalls in three years, the government is allowed to call you anytime or you might incur a Rs 15 lakh fine,"" she alleges.



Further, she claims, ""It's not a meritocratic system. It's not exactly for the betterment of people.""



In conclusion, she said, ""We are still helping people by serving as junior residents in colleges and we want to complete our education by the time we are 30 and start paying off the loans we took to fund our education.""",no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no

But, what if the answer sheet is eliminated? It could help save around 1.4 crore sheets of paper a year from Manipal Academy of Higher Education (MAHE) alone. To achieve this, students of MAHE use e-pad (exam pad), a tablet PC on which they scribble seamlessly with the help of a stylus.

Vinod V Thomas, Registrar, Evaluation, MAHE, told businessline that MAHE believes in academic transparency and environmental friendliness. The primary goal of digitising the assessment and evaluation process is to make it transparent, error-free and fast, with the added benefit of less manpower and environmental friendliness.

MAHE offers 277 academic programmes in the faculties of Health Sciences; Science, Technology and Management; and Humanities, Liberal Arts, and Social Sciences across five campuses. About 29,150 students are enrolled in these programmes.

‚ÄúSince most of the examinations were conducted in digital format, we were able to save around 1.4 crore sheets, which would have saved around 500 trees as per the calculations provided by an organisation, ‚ÄòConservatree‚Äô,‚Äù he said. Around 16,000 students wrote 7.77 lakh examinations in the last five years using e-pads.

How it works

Before the start of the examination, students are asked to calibrate their stylus using an application available on the e-pad. This helps to adjust the angle at which students hold the stylus, the pressure they apply while writing and so on, allowing them to follow their regular handwriting styles.

Once a particular student is registered for an examination, his/her roll number will be tagged to the registered courses and automatically to their respective biometric data. On the day of the examination, students will be provided with an e-pad, on which they have to authenticate themselves using their biometric data and take their examination.

The evaluators too login on a computer using their biometrics to conduct valuation. Unless all the questions are evaluated, they cannot submit the script. In addition, automated tabulation eliminates the chances of counting mistakes and missing evaluations.

All the documents in the e-pad‚Äôs cloud are end-to-end encrypted and will get decrypted only for the assigned users, Thomas said.

MAHE was the first university to implement the e-pad system developed by a Singapore-based company in 2016. ‚ÄúBased on our feedback and suggestions at multiple times, the product got developed and implemented,‚Äù he said.

Paper vs e-pad

At MAHE, exams were originally conducted in the traditional way ‚Äî with paper-based hall tickets, question papers and answer sheets. ‚ÄúIn a large university like ours, where many exams were taking place, this was a laborious process involving several staff,‚Äù he said.

In the e-pad, evaluation happens on-screen. Teachers can enter the marks as well as the comments, if any, on the screen, thereby eliminating the possibility of totalling errors. Through this, the institute can also generate a consolidated mark sheet straight away for result-processing.

With the e-pad system, MAHE could publish the results of all major exams within one week from the date of the last exam, he said. ‚ÄúSince the answer papers are available as electronic files, we can save it for a longer duration without the fear of losing it. Also, this will not occupy any physical space. The e-format makes the data retrieval process seamless and fast,‚Äù he said.

Students say that the feeling of writing is as good as on a paper surface. Manoj M Mallya, a final-year engineering student at Manipal Institute of Technology, said the speed of writing is the same in both the paper and e-pad.

Asked about the use of formulas while answering queries, he said a handbook has been embedded within the e-pad and students can refer to the handbook while writing answers.

Ronel Fernandes, third-year student of Kasturba Medical College of MAHE, said students can use the stylus on the e-pad for drawing as well. There are options for selecting multiple colours, drawing tools and so on. This avoids carrying piles of stationery to the hall, and drawings can be presented in a visually appealing manner, he said.

AP Poorvi, third year B.Com student from Department of Commerce of MAHE, said students were given orientation after joining the course on the use of the e-pad system. There are even options for selecting page types such as ruled or unruled, line spacing, she said.",no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no

New Delhi: As part of ICMR's trial run, a tissue sample was transported mid-surgery from a peripheral hospital in Karnataka for advanced pathological testing at a tertiary setting for deciding if the resected tissue was cancerous. In continuance with the national mission of expanding drone ecosystem in the country, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) successfully conducted the trial run of transporting onco-pathological samples by drones under its i-Drone initiative on Wednesday. The drone efficiently transported intraoperative surgical biospecimens surgically excised from the patient from Dr TMA Pai Hospital, Karkala to Kasturba Medical College , Manipal Academy of Higher Education Manipal (tertiary care hospital), covering a distance of approximately 37 km in 15-20 minutes, which takes around 50-60 minutes by road, an official statement said.

Upon arrival, the sample was promptly analysed, and the report was electronically conveyed back to the peripheral hospital. Subsequently, the surgeon proceeded with the surgery based on the received report, it said. The trial run as part of a validation study has been undertaken for the first time in the country by the collaborative efforts of ICMR, Kasturba Medical College (KMC) and Dr TMA PAI Rotary Hospital.

Drones play a crucial role in agriculture, defence, disaster relief and healthcare, especially during emergency situations by enabling rapid delivery of vaccines, medications, and vital supplies to remote and inaccessible areas, the statement stated.

The ICMR along with Kasturba Medical College is currently conducting a feasibility study in Manipal, Karnataka. The study aims to evaluate the potential use of aerial transportation systems (drones), to transport items such as pathology samples from secondary healthcare facilities to tertiary-level hospitals, the statement said.

It should therefore provide some reassurance that the number of Indian programmes featuring across our 55 subject rankings and five broad faculty areas has increased this year ‚Äì from 355 to 454. QS also notes that several programmes at India‚Äôs three privately-run Institutes of Eminence have made progress this year, demonstrating the positive role that well-regulated private provision can have in enhancing India‚Äôs higher education sector.‚Äù

Turner added: ‚ÄúWhile there is still a lot of work to be done to improve standards, access to higher education, universities‚Äô digital readiness and global competitiveness, it is clear that India is taking significant steps in the right direction.‚Äù

The most represented Indian universities in this edition of the rankings (Excluding the five broad faculty areas) are the University of Delhi (30 entries), the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay (28 entries) and the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur (27 entries).

Research strength

In this year's QS World University Rankings by Subject, India has demonstrated significant progress, with a notable 20% improvement in the Citations per Paper indicator, reflecting a strong research capability. Additionally, there has been a 16% growth in the International Research Network indicator which measure the volume and diversity or research partnerships. However, there was a slight decrease of 5% in the H Index, which assesses the balance between research productivity and its impact.

Ben Sowter, QS senior vice president, said, ‚ÄúIn terms of volume, India is now the world's fourth-largest producer of research, generating 1.3 million academic papers in this period, trailing only behind China's 4.5 million, the United States' 4.4 million, and slightly less than the United Kingdom's 1.4 million.‚Äù

Sowter added, ‚ÄúGiven its current trajectory, India is on the brink of overtaking the United Kingdom in research productivity. However, in terms of research impact, measured by citation count, India ranks ninth globally for the 2017-2022 period. While it is an impressive result, prioritising high-quality, impactful research and its dissemination within the academic community is the essential next step.‚Äù

He concluded, ‚ÄúDespite facing challenges such as enhancing research standards, educating the world's largest school-age population, growing the economy and the labour market to match the rapidly increasing number of job seekers, while securing a position of global competitiveness, India is becoming a formidable player the international academic community.‚Äù

The 2024 QS World University Rankings by Subject compiled provide independent comparative analysis on the performance of over 16,400 individual university programmes, taken by students at 1500+ universities which can be found in 95 countries and territories, across 56 academic disciplines and five broad faculty areas (Arts & Humanities, Engineering & Technology, Life Sciences, Natural Sciences and Social Sciences).",no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no
UGC allows 18 Karnataka universities to collaborate with foreign universities,news.google.com/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVoaW5kdS5jb20vbmV3cy9uYXRpb25hbC9rYXJuYXRha2EvdWdjLWFsbG93cy0xOC1rYXJuYXRha2EtdW5pdmVyc2l0aWVzLXRvLWNvbGxhYm9yYXRlLXdpdGgtZm9yZWlnbi11bml2ZXJzaXRpZXMvYXJ0aWNsZTY4MTkwODM3LmVjZdIBlwFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVoaW5kdS5jb20vbmV3cy9uYXRpb25hbC9rYXJuYXRha2EvdWdjLWFsbG93cy0xOC1rYXJuYXRha2EtdW5pdmVyc2l0aWVzLXRvLWNvbGxhYm9yYXRlLXdpdGgtZm9yZWlnbi11bml2ZXJzaXRpZXMvYXJ0aWNsZTY4MTkwODM3LmVjZS9hbXAv?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen,24-May,The Hindu,"The University Grant Commission (UGC) has approved a proposal for 18 State universities and higher educational institutions (HEIs) in Karnataka to collaborate with foreign institutions to offer twinning, joint degree, or dual degree programmes.

Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru, National Law School of India University (NLSIU), University of Agricultural Sciences (UAS), Bengaluru, University of Mysore, Visvesaraya Technological University (VTU), and private universities like Manipal Academy of Higher Education (Deemed to be University) and Christ (Deemed to be University) are among the 18 that have received approval for collaboration with foreign universities.

Courses such as psychology, nursing, engineering, information technology, biotechnology, law, human rights, arts and humanities, and others have received the nod.

Under the National Education Policy (NEP-2020), the UGC has notified the University Grants Commission (Academic Collaboration between Indian and Foreign Higher Educational Institutions to offer Twinning, Joint Degree and Dual Degree Programmes) Regulations, 2022, on May 2, 2022.

These regulations promote enhanced academic collaboration with foreign higher educational institutions, leading to academic and research excellence in Indian HEIs. Academic and research collaboration, as well as the mobility of students and faculty through joint degree and dual degree programmes, is expected to help Indian HEIs achieve higher global rankings.

A twinning programme will be a collaborative arrangement in which students enrolled with an Indian HEI will study partly in India and partly in the foreign HEI and then be awarded a degree by the Indian HEI.

For a joint degree programme, the curriculum will be designed jointly by the collaborating Indian and foreign HEIs. Upon completion of the programme, the Indian HEI and the collaborating foreign HEI will award the degree with a single certificate.

The dual degree programme will be jointly designed and offered by the Indian and foreign HEIs in the same disciplines/subject areas and at the same level. The degrees for such a programme will be conferred by the Indian and foreign HEIs, separately and simultaneously, upon completion of the degree requirements of both institutions. This will not be construed as two-degree programmes in separate disciplines/subject areas and/or levels being pursued simultaneously.

However, the UGC also has some conditions for collaboration; Indian HEIs shall obtain the approval of its appropriate authority, like the Board of Governors/Board of Management/Syndicate/Executive Council, for academic collaboration with any Foreign HEIs. The Indian HEIs will have to seek the necessary approval from the relevant statutory councils/bodies before entering into collaboration in technical, medical, legal, agricultural and other professional programmes.

Speaking to The Hindu, S. Vidyashankar, Vice Chancellor of VTU, said, ‚ÄúPreparations have already been made for the MoU with foreign universities. Earlier, we had entered into agreements with some foreign universities regarding teaching exchange and research. We also allowed our students to do internships and project work at any university in the world. Now, we have taken steps to sign an agreement for the twinning programme with Temple University of Philadelphia, USA. In this regard, two rounds of talks have already been held, and the third round of talks will be held soon. In addition, an agreement will be made with foreign universities to come to India and offer twinning programmes.‚Äù",no,no,no,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no

Today marks the significant milestone in your lives as you transit from being graduates to professionals who will shape the future of health care.

As you are aware, we are witnessing a period of great transformation, both within our country and across the globe. India‚Äôs position and image within the global order today is one of a nation which is proud of its heritage, confident of its capabilities and certain of its aspirations and goals. For our Nation to achieve its aspirations and goals, it is incumbent upon each one of us to commit to the philosophy of ‚ÄòNation First‚Äô.‚Äù

Speaking at the Press Conference Dr H.S. Ballal, Pro Chancellor, MAHE, said, ‚ÄúOur founder Dr TMA Pai, in 1942, established the Academy of General Education as a society to provide technical and commercial education to all interested individuals. He was a visionary leader who excelled in multiple fields. He was a doctor, banker, and educationist all rolled into one. His initial goal was to train those who failed 10th grade in vocational skills like carpentry, plumbing, electrical work, and masonry. The Academy went on to establish professional colleges in medicine, pioneering the country‚Äôs first private self-financing medical colleges in 1953 despite opposition. Concurrently, colleges were started in engineering, dentistry, pharmacy, architecture, law, education, management, and more.

Kasturba Medical College, the flagship institution of MAHE, was the first private self-financing medical college founded by Dr. TMA Pai in 1953. It was the 29th medical college in the nation at the time. Today, India boasts over 600 medical colleges, and we are proud that Kasturba has consistently ranked among the top 10 for over 20 years.

Dr. TMA Pai‚Äôs dream of establishing a university was not realized during his lifetime. His beloved son Dr. Ramdas M Pai, the current Chancellor of MAHE, took over in 1979 and established Manipal Academy of Higher Education (MAHE) in 1993 by attaining deemed university status from the Government of India under UGC Act 1956. Dr. Ramdas Pai transformed Manipal into an international university township and pioneered Indian higher education abroad. His steadfast integrity has been the foundation on which today‚Äôs Manipal is built.‚Äù

During the Press Conference Lt Gen (Dr) M.D. Venkatesh, VSM (Retd), Vice Chancellor, MAHE, said ‚ÄúLegacy of our university is built on pioneering efforts of visionary academicians, professors, thinkers, and perhaps, most importantly people who have dared to demand change. MAHE always benchmarks itself against global standards and sets time-bound action plans to achieve its stated goals and objectives. We are counted among the best academic institutions and our strong focus on internalization follows years of building relations with some of the best universities in the world to exchange ideas, cultures and best practices. We are looking into redefining our expertise for further connecting people and thoughts across an international network for the benefit of all our stakeholders‚Äù.

While the institution‚Äôs top-notch research infrastructure caters to our imminent needs, we will continue to fund and prioritise research in our latest phase of transformation. The Research defines our mindset and has been a hallmark of our excellence over the years. Moving ahead we will seek to continue our research journey with renewed vigour using our formidable national and international collaborations to take our scholarly output to the next level.

Dr Giridhar Kini P, Registrar, MAHE, spoke about the upcoming changes in academics, stating, ‚ÄúWe envision MAHE evolving and adopting innovative ideas that address a wide range of academic challenges and provide solutions to overcoming them. Education is at a transformational point: Teaching methods are changing, and education systems are shifting from classroom concepts to more practical, experiential learning. Today‚Äôs job market demands more from graduates, so we have stepped up our efforts and refreshed our academic assessments to increasingly emphasize innovation and entrepreneurship. This is the age where innovators are valued, and MAHE aims to provide an environment where students don‚Äôt just learn course content but develop an enterprising mindset. We believe this will define our legacy in the coming years and make a mark on the country‚Äôs educational landscape. We are also seeing a good placement and admission season and are hopeful that things will further improve. The implementation of the NEP policy is a welcome change and will definitely help build a stronger, value-based higher education system.‚Äù",no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,yes,no,no

Since its inception, the institute has been dedicated to nurturing young lawyers, giving students access to progressive, adaptive, and innovative legal education.

The students from the 2018 batch of MBBS at KMC Manipal highlighted that they were not informed about the bond at the time of admission to the MBBS course.

MBBS students in government medical colleges are made to undergo a compulsory one-year rural medical service, however, the same hasn't been applied to the students from private medical colleges and deemed universities yet, the students said.

‚ÄúIt makes sense for the government medical college students as their education is subsidised by the government to give back to society through their service. However, our education is self-financed and it is not justified to impose the same. Students in private medical colleges spend Rs 50 to 60 lakh, minimum, on their education,‚Äù a student from the 2018 batch at KMC Manipal informed EdexLive, on the condition of anonymity.

In 2015, the government of Karnataka had introduced a bill stating any doctor graduating from Karnataka must do one year of rural service, even private and deemed university students were included. However, this was revised, removing private and deemed universities from this arrangement.

Now, the students are being asked to sign an affidavit for undertaking compulsory rural service for one year, and to submit a No-Objection Certificate (NOC) issued by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in order to obtain their permanent registration with the Karnataka Medical Council.

The affidavit mentions that the students have to serve in a government institute for one year and if they choose to discharge from their obligation of the compulsory rural service, they would have to pay a penalty of Rs 15 to Rs 30 lakh to the government.

These new changes are being implemented by the Karnataka Government under the draft Karnataka Compulsory Service by Candidates Completed Medical Courses (Counseling, Allotment and Certification) (Amendment) Rules, 2024.

However, the students say that since the draft rules are yet to be passed, the bond service is being implemented ‚Äòillegally‚Äô on the 2018 batch of students.

The students have now moved the Karnataka High Court challenging the state government‚Äôs amendment rules and a hearing date is yet to be assigned.",no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,no,no

According to EdexLive, the plea has been filed by the 2018 batch of MBBS students from Kasturba Medical College (KMC), which is a constituent private medical college under Manipal Academy of Higher Education (MAHE), Deemed University.



As per the rules, MBBS students enrolled in government medical colleges must undergo a compulsory one-year rural medical service. However, the students pointed out that the bond condition has not yet been applied to the students enrolled in private medical colleges and deemed universities.

Commenting on the matter, a student from the 2018 batch at KMC Manipal told Edex Live on the condition of anonymity, ""It makes sense for the government medical college students as their education is subsidised by the government to give back to society through their service. However, our education is self-financed and it is not justified to impose the same. Students in private medical colleges spend Rs 50 to 60 lakh, minimum, on their education.""

Although one-year compulsory rural service was mandatory only for the medicos from government medical colleges, Karnataka Compulsory Service Training by Candidates completed Medical Courses Act, 2012 made it applicable to the medical graduates from private medical colleges as well.

Medical Dialogues had earlier reported that last year, introducing major changes in compulsory rural service policy in Karnataka, the State Health Department had proposed restricting it only to the students in government medical colleges. The State Health Department proposed this policy change with the aim to lessen the financial burden on the government. It was being estimated that the policy change could lead to Rs 544 crore in annual savings.

Even though rural service was made mandatory for medical graduates from private medical institutes as well, this provision was later revised, removing the private and deemed universities from this arrangement.

Meanwhile, according to EdexLive, now the medicos are being asked to sign an affidavit for undertaking compulsory rural service for a period of one year and also to submit a No-Objection Certificate (NOC) issued by the Union Health Ministry to obtain their permanent registration with the Karnataka Medical Council.

It is being mentioned in the affidavit that the students will serve in a government institute for one year and if they choose not to undergo the mandatory bond service, they would be liable to pay a penalty of Rs 15 to Rs 30 lakh to the government.

The Karnataka Government is implementing these new changes under the draft Karnataka Compulsory Service by Candidates Completed Medical Courses (Counseling, Allotment and Certification) (Amendment) Rules, 2024.

However, the students have alleged that since the draft rules have not been passed yet, the bond service requirement is being implemented 'illegally' on the 2018 batch of students. Therefore, challenging these new amendment rules of the Government, the students have now moved the Karnataka High Court, which is yet to assign a hearing date for the matter.

The program‚Äôs initial phase spans 2 years, during which students can choose to study either at MAHE Manipal or in Antigua. Following this foundation, students transition to Manipal‚Äôs AUA to complete the subsequent 4.5 years, which encompasses 2.5 years of pre-clinical sciences at the state-of-the-art Antigua campus, followed by 2 years of clinical rotations conducted in various locations including the USA, UK & Canada.

Led by faculty members from various functions and departments, the comprehensive orientation program not only introduced students to MAHE but also highlighted their pivotal role in taking on the responsibility of guiding and mentoring the students throughout their two-year tenure. The students‚Äô determination was clearly visible as they eagerly set out on their journey, aspiring to earn a medical degree and become practising doctors in the USA through Manipal‚Äôs AUA.

One of the student‚Äôs parents remarked, ‚ÄúMy daughter had a longstanding interest in studying medicine abroad. However, I had reservations about sending her overseas immediately after her 12th grade. Discovering the Manipal AUA program, which allows students to complete the first 2 years of their studies in India before going abroad, was a game-changer for us.‚Äù

Ashmit Basera from Dehradun shared that his sister had been a student at Manipal six years ago, and he too was eagerly looking forward to becoming part of this vibrant and picturesque green campus. He was especially excited about using the world-class sports facilities at Marena.

The American University of Antigua (AUA) College of Medicine, a unit of the Manipal Education and Medical Group, was established in 2004 to tackle the escalating shortage of physicians within the United States. Benefiting from the rich 70-year heritage of the Manipal group in medical education and healthcare, AUA has transformed into a center for global education, spanning an advanced 150,000 sq. ft. campus equipped with cutting-edge technology.

In commemoration of World Suicide Prevention Week, the Department of Liberal Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences (DLHS) at Manipal Academy of Higher Education (MAHE), Bengaluru spearheaded a suicide awareness campaign, aimed at destigmatizing mental health concerns, fostering open dialogue, and amplifying awareness about suicide prevention. Embracing this year‚Äôs theme, ""Creating hope through action,"" MAHE orchestrated a series of impactful initiatives, ranging from enlightening talks to community rallies and an engaging creative poster-making competition.

Challenges Faced by Indian College Students:

In India, youth and student suicides have been a pressing concern due to various factors, including academic pressure, competition, social expectations, and mental health challenges. For college students, the transition to higher education often intensifies these stressors, with demanding coursework, intense academic competition, and the weighty decisions associated with their future careers. This transition period can be emotionally taxing, especially for individuals in need of mental health support.

According to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) Accidental Deaths & Suicides in India (ADSI) report, more than 13,000 students lost their lives in 2021, equating to over 35 suicides every day in India, ranking the country 41st in the list of nations with the highest suicide rates. Globally, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that more than 700,000 suicides occur annually.

MAHE Bengaluru's Commitment to Student Well-being:

Dr. Shilpa Kalyan, Associate Professor and HoD, Department of Liberal Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences, MAHE Bengaluru said, ‚ÄúIn education, we possess the power to inspire, develop, and shape the minds of the future. Our responsibilities extend beyond textbooks and curricular to include the physical and emotional well-being of our students. We lay the foundation for their success and enjoyment by creating a loving and supportive atmosphere. This Suicide Awareness campaign demonstrates MAHE-Bengaluru's dedication to addressing the pressing issue of suicide prevention while promoting a culture of hope, open communication, and community support.‚Äù

Throughout the week, DLHS conducted an engaging session with Dr Ashwini NV, Founder and Director of the Muktaa Charitable Foundation, a not-for-profit public trust founded by socially conscious citizens on September 13th. On September 14th, more than 100 psychology students organized a community awareness program, spreading slogans focused on creating hope through actions in a street play. The week concluded on September 15th with a poster-making competition, engaging the students of MAHE Bengaluru.

This initiative by MAHE Bengaluru serves as a crucial step in addressing the critical issue of suicide prevention, promoting mental health awareness, and fostering a sense of hope, unity, and open dialogue within the campus community.",no,no,yes,yes,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,yes,yes,no

Bone Bank inaugurated at KMC Hospital in Manipal,news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWhpbmR1LmNvbS9uZXdzL2NpdGllcy9NYW5nYWxvcmUvYm9uZS1iYW5rLWluYXVndXJhdGVkLWF0LWttYy1ob3NwaXRhbC1pbi1tYW5pcGFsL2FydGljbGU2NzMxODA3Ni5lY2XSAXhodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVoaW5kdS5jb20vbmV3cy9jaXRpZXMvTWFuZ2Fsb3JlL2JvbmUtYmFuay1pbmF1Z3VyYXRlZC1hdC1rbWMtaG9zcGl0YWwtaW4tbWFuaXBhbC9hcnRpY2xlNjczMTgwNzYuZWNlL2FtcC8?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen,17-Sep-23,The Hindu,"Ranjan R Pai, Chairman of Manipal Education and Medical Group inaugurated a bone bank at Kasturba Medical College and Hospital in Manipal on September 17. Opening the bank was an initiative of the Manipal Foundation.

Speaking on the occasion, Harinarayan Sharma, Chief Executive Officer of Manipal Foundation said that setting up of the bone bank in Manipal is the first of its kind in Manipal network hospitals.

M. D. Venkatesh, Vice-Chancellor, Manipal Academy of Higher Education (MAHE) said that the bone bank allografts are cheaper and superior than the commercially available alternatives, despite the cost incurred in processing/radiation-sterilisation of the donor bone (to be borne by the recipient), a release from the hospital said.

Monappa Naik Aroor, Professor of Orthopaedics at the hospital and convener of the bone bank said that, massive bone grafts are needed in managing large bone defects in tumour resection (especially in younger children where autografts is not a valid choice to reconstruct larger defects), gap non-union of fractured bones and defect management of joint reconstruction/revision surgeries. Allografts constitute the tissue transplants within the members of the same species which are genetically non-identical (human to human). The source of bone is from potential living or deceased healthy voluntary donors.

Bone parts resected during joint replacement (arthroplasty) procedures and in selected amputations are the main sources of living donors (otherwise these are discarded as bio-waste). All these donated bones undergo a series of processing (to make it free from blood, fat, contamination and micro-organisms) to make it safe and infection free for usage (upcycling). The bone bank consists of wet and dry processing areas apart from the documentation/receiving area, deep freezer room and storage/distribution area.

After processing of the donor bone (dissection, cutting, washing, pasteurisation, freeze-drying, packing, labelling and sealing), ensuring the high quality and safety (moisture-free and low bioburden), the material should be end sterilised with Gamma radiation. With all these procedures (procuring, curing, storing, distributing), the bone bank will be the source for upcycled bone tissue as allografts (freeze-dried Gamma irradiated end product) for the needful massive grafts in Orthopaedic reconstructive surgeries. Bone bank allografts will solve the issues of size/amount of graft needed.

Avinash Shetty, Medical Superintendent of the hospital said that once the licensing for this project is completed, the products will be available for the therapeutic purpose.
